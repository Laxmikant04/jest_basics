The Mock Function-

The goal for mocking is to replace something we donâ€™t control with something we do.

The Mock Function provides features to:

    1.Capture calls
    2.Set return values
    3.Change the implementation

The simplest way to create a Mock Function instance is with jest.fn()


There are three main types of module and function mocking in Jest:

    1.jest.fn: Mock a function
    2.jest.mock: Mock a module
    3.jest.spyOn: Spy or mock a function
